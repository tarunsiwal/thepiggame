In 2021, I developed a simple JavaScript game called the Pig Game as part of my learning journey in JavaScript.
The Pig Game is a turn-based dice game where players compete to reach 100 points first. Players roll a die and 
accumulate points, but rolling a 1 resets their turn score to zero. They can choose to 'Hold' to add the turn 
score to their total score, passing the turn to the next player. The game features intuitive controls and 
dynamic updates, providing an engaging way to apply fundamental JavaScript concepts such as event handling,
DOM manipulation, and conditional logic.
